a. What will a jumper do if the location in front of it is empty, but the
location two cells in front contains a flower or a rock?[a]
The jumper will go forward one space, but if there is a flower or rock in both spaces in front of it, it will turn 90 degrees.


b. What will a jumper do if the location two cells in front of the jumper is
out of the grid?
Only move forward one space. 


c. What will a jumper do if it is facing an edge of the grid?
If one space forward is also outside the grid, turn.

d. [d]What will a jumper do if another actor (not a flower or a rock) is in the
cell that is two cells in front of the jumper?
It will move forwards one space or turn if something is in that cell. 


e. What will a jumper do if it encounters another jumper in its path?
If the other jumper is one space ahead, jump over it. If it is 2 spaces ahead, only move forward 1 space. If there are other jumpers in both the space ahead and 2 ahead, turn.


f. Are there any other tests the jumper needs to make?
If the jumper is surrounded, it will just turn in circles until a space opens.

Essentially: move 2 spaces forward, if it can’t, move 1 space forward, if it can’t, turn
