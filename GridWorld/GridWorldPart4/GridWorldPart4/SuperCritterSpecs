SuperCritter.java

The critter moves to one of two locations a chess distance of 2 (which is 2 units forward the direction it’s facing and 
then 1 unit 90 degrees(right or left - randomly chosen) from the way it originally faces, after the move it will face the 
direction it moved in(90 degrees left or 90 degrees right depends on which way it moved in))) from the original position, 
and then faces the direction it moved in last. As the critter moves, if it has a neighbor (anything but a rock), it changes 
that neighbor into a critter of the same color as the original actor in its spot. If the neighbor it chooses is a critter, 
nothing happens. For example, if a blue critter has a red flower as a neighbor, it will change the red flower to a red 
critter. If the critter has nowhere to move (if both the locations that it can go to are filled), it will die.
(removed from the grid). If the critter reaches the edge of the screen, it dies.
